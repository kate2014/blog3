With 3 of my friends I used to join the department-held hackathon at
HKUST. One of which named Ivan, a talented programmer who were also
somewhat experienced in image editing and video processing.

We brainstormed a lot before the hackathon and ended up with 1 idea the
majority of us agreed on.
Of course, we needed a design before we start validation or
development, that
responsibility fell on Ivan's shoulder despite he were the minority who
opposed the idea.

Ivan did a fine work, we got a design the next day. We came to
discover that the idea we suppored yesterday could hardly impress us
anymore. Back to the drawing board, we brainstormed again.

Of course the one who spent the night creating a design was
dissatisfied. Ivan, losing trust on the other teammates, disagreed to
create any design until the rest of the team make a final decision, the
one killer idea we would never diverge from.

The team were demotivated, and it was nobody's fault. Product feature
idea and direction changes according to the circumtance. Everybody
who builds product knows it, but not all can deal with it calmly.

### Impromptu change and vague requirement demotivate people

Recalling the experience with the product manager and another engineer in
Taiwan, we have spent a big chunk of our time working on something and
had it thrown away because 1) we didn't validate it beforehand or 2) the
project manager has a better idea/something more valuable to do.

We never gave him a good face whenever the PM wanted to change. Over
time there developed a sentiment that if a feature is not well-designed
and validated with the users, we shouldn't work on it. We played with
cat instead.

The situation were made worse because our 'PM' were less of detail-focused
person but more of big-picture driven and gave nothing more than a sentence
rather. As an CEO that is fine, but as an PM, that is unacceptable.

> Don't ask me to do it until you're absolutely sure.

We were demotivated. Task assignment became long discussion and took lots
of persuasion. The unhealthy tension between the devs and the PM
required much negotiations and trust building before the devs agreed to
work and the PM promised to not change the schedule until the end of the
sprint.

It was that moment that I realized what Ivan felt when I piped his
night-worth of work into `/dev/null`*. And the prospect of the project
were gloomy.

<small>* nerdy way to say 'void', 'nothingness'</small>

Vroom's Expectancy theory states that individuals motivation comes from
the belief that efforts are positively correlated to performance, and
that performance results in an outcome that brings reward that satisfies
an individual's need.

Now think about it, effort were paid yet there comes no performance nor
outcome because the work were trashed. While rewards (paycheck) were
given every month, developers seek more than monetary rewards. They
value the sense of achievement when they deploy a feature with nice code
and novel approaches.

Therefore impromptu change in plan negates developers' paid efforts and
brough nothing but demotivation.

### Feature ownership motivates people

- feels good when John asked me about membership feature
- git praise
- if I contributed to the idea I am more happy to do it

### Feedback and discussion are the keys

- solution: give and take feedback between idea owner and tech ppl
