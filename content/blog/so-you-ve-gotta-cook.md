During my 3-month internship in San Francisco, choices of meals was a big concern everyday.
Balancing the need for delicious foods, the walk distance to get food, and cost for food (double of
that in Hong Kong) has been a troublesome task.

Solution? You've gotta cook.

In a household of 3-4 guys which most don't care about taste as long as
the food is edible, cooking together is a good activity to bond, relieve stresses,
save money, and most importantly getting our stomaches filled.

This post is a living document over the duration of my internship (mid
June - mid Sept) in which I post (unorganized and sometimes inaccurate) recipes of
our meals. I cannot guarantee they are all delicious or healthy because most of us in
the house don't care :p
