During my 3-month internship in San Francisco, choices of meals was a big concern everyday.
Balancing the need for delicious foods, the walk distance to get food, and cost for food (double of
that in Hong Kong) has been a troublesome task.

Solution? You've gotta cook.

In a household of 3-4 guys which most don't care about taste as long as
the food is edible, cooking together is a good activity to bond, relieve stresses,
save money, and most importantly getting our stomaches filled.

This post is a living document over the duration of my internship (mid
June - mid Sept) in which I post (unorganized and sometimes inaccurate) recipes of
our meals. I cannot guarantee they are all delicious or healthy because most of us in
the house don't care :p

Special thanks to Morten Koldby for teaching me this dish.

### Steps (as taught by Morten)

1. Sear the meat in the pot first.
1. When the meat is caramelized on the edges, put in the onions and fry them lightly.
1. Then pour the stock over the meat & onion and put in the spices. Put in 2-4 bay leafs and maybe a spoonful of thyme.
1. Let it simmer for at least 30 minutes, maybe 45-50.

This one is pretty messed up because all liquid boiled off while simmering. I should have added in enough beef stock.
The resultant slightly charred beef had thick sauce on the surface and may have been too salty.
