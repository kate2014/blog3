Cold hard fact: 50% of the time my design sucks, for the rest of the time
they never look perfect.

Now it's 2016, Twitter bots' been around for years; Slack, Telegram and
Facebook Messager all have SDKs for building custom bots. One particular
characteristics of chatbots is that they don't need a rich interface to
function. Plain text + emoji will do.

Albeit various bot API enables for customized experience from
inline keyboard all the way to webview and HTML5 games. This article
focuses on the textual experience because, again, my design sucks.
