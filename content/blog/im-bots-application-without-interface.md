Fact check: I am no designer. I make webapp and websites from time to
time but much of the design were either borrowed or took hours of minor
adjustment. (now you know why my blog looks so [brutalist](https://theamericangenius.com/business-marketing/brutalist-web-design/))

Now it's 2016, Twitter bots' been around for years; Slack, Telegram and
Facebook Messager all have SDKs for building custom bots. One particular
characteristics of chatbots is that they don't need a rich interface to
function. Plain text + emoji will do.

Albeit various bot APIs enable for a customized experience from
inline keyboard all the way to webview and even HTML5 games. This article
focuses on the basic textual experience one could implement with
Telegram bot easily.
