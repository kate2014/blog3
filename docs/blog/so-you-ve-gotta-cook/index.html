<p>During my 3-month internship in San Francisco, choices of meals was a big concern everyday.
Balancing the need for delicious foods, the walk distance to get food, and cost for food (double of
that in Hong Kong) has been a troublesome task.</p>

<p>Solution? You’ve gotta cook.</p>

<p>In a household of 3-4 guys which most don’t care about taste as long as
the food is edible, cooking together is a good activity to bond, relieve stresses,
save money, and most importantly getting our stomaches filled.</p>

<p>This post is a living document over the duration of my internship (mid
June - mid Sept) in which I post (unorganized and sometimes inaccurate) recipes of
our meals. I cannot guarantee they are all delicious or healthy because most of us in
the house don’t care :p</p>

<p>Special thanks to Morten Koldby for teaching me this dish.</p>

<h3 id="steps-as-taught-by-morten">Steps (as taught by Morten)</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Sear the meat in the pot first.</li>
  <li>When the meat is caramelized on the edges, put in the onions and fry them lightly.</li>
  <li>Then pour the stock over the meat &amp; onion and put in the spices. Put in 2-4 bay leafs and maybe a spoonful of thyme.</li>
  <li>Let it simmer for at least 30 minutes, maybe 45-50.</li>
</ol>

<p>This one is pretty messed up because all liquid boiled off while simmering. I should have added in enough beef stock.
The resultant slightly charred beef had thick sauce on the surface and may have been too salty.</p>
