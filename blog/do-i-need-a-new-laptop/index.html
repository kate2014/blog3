looking for a new laptop to replace my then 4-year old now 5 <a href="http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/thinkpad/x-series/x230/">Thinkpad X230</a>.</p>

<p>Although I didn’t get a new one, I didn’t keep the ‘old one’ either. Instead of
buying the latest 12.5 inch offering in the X series (<a href="http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/thinkpad/x-series/x260/">Thinkpad X260</a>),
I have upgraded my Thinkpad X230 parts to keep up with the laptop spec
nowadays.</p>

<p>Some might have noticed that before <a href="../working-in-taipei-for-a-month">my trip to Taipei</a>
last August, I upgraded the RAM from 4GB to 8GB dual channel
DDR3 1600MHz. That saved my laptop from freezing while compiling Android
apps. This time, I upgraded the 512GB 7200rpm hard disk to a 275GB
Crucial MX300 solid state drive, bringing a sharp performance boost.</p>

<p>The two upgrades costed me $860HKD ($220 for RAM and $640 for SSD)
— not cheap, but looking at its potential substitute the Thinkpad
X260, which starts at $8108HKD for comparable spec, this is quite a good
deal. Although X260 does use RAM with higher clock rate, a <a href="http://cpuboss.com/cpus/Intel-Core-i5-6200U-vs-Intel-Core-i5-3210M">slightly</a>
<a href="http://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Intel-Core-i5-6200U-vs-Intel-Core-i5-3210M/m36796vs2719">faster</a> CPU,
and an option to upgrade to a full HD IPS panel, X230 offers what X260
doesn’t — upgradability.</p>

<p>X230’s RAM slots back cover and a hard disk bay cover can be
removed with just 5 screws. On X260, the whole back
plate <a href="http://www.laptopmain.com/how-to-disassemble-lenovo-thinkpad-x260-to-upgrade-ssd-and-ram/">has to be removed</a>
before one could access the only RAM slot and the hard disk. X260
didn’t allow for simple upgrade and it was nobody’s fault. To keep X260’s
compact form factor sacrifices had to be made and I was really surprised
that at least they are not soldering everything on like the 2016 X1 carbon.</p>

<p>I am a die-hard fan of the Thinkpad X-series despite many prefer Macbook
more. The upgradability of my X230 enables it to extend its usable life
beyond 5 years which is hardly achievable without desoldering something
on a Macbook. Despite battery life is my next concern, I would happily
set sail on my trustworthy better than ever 5-year old laptop for the time being.</p>
